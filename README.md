# Data Structures

## About

This project was born as a PoC (Proof of Concept) for data structures in C programming language. The intent of this project is to develop common data structures and data structures used at my university class that accept any type of data using C language and use a testing framework (CUnit in this case) to assure the code quality.

For the sake of simplicity Linux is the only OS supported.
