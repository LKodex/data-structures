## About de Project

This project was made as PoC (Proof of Concept) for using generic data types in C language intended to be used by data structures learned at data structures class. Also a testing framework for C language, in this case I chose CUnit after a brief search.

To accomplish a simple compilation for all that (source code compilation, tests compilation, release/debug build and test build) I studied a little bit the GNU C Compiler and Makefiles. Doesn't work on Windows cause it needs the CUnit shared library and I only know a way to install it on Linux (needs to add the dependencies at the README file, still needs create the README file though).
